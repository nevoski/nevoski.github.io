    <p id="project_title">KitchenTime App Landing Page</p>
    <div id="main_container">
        <p class="title">The Project</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Overview</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I was asked to design a landing page as well as mockup screens for the KitchenTime mobile app. The idea behind the app is that a user can type in whatever ingredients they have on hand, the app will search for recipes using those ingredients, and then provide step-by-step instructions on how to make that recipe.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This project was completed over the course of one week.</p>
        <p class="title">Research</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Layout Analysis</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For inspiration, I took a look at the landing pages for some of KitchenTimeâ€™s competitors. I knew I had to describe the functionality of the app clearly and simply, as well as showcase screens from the app itself. I was going for simplicity rather than information overload, so some of my biggest inspiration came from Pepperplate and Venmo, even though Venmo is not a direct competitor.</p>

        <p class="title">Wireframing</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I used wireframing to help me visualize a number of different layouts, taking inspiration from competitors. I liked the idea of breaking the landing page up into big sections, each one detailing a different aspect of the app, and so I created a number of possible layouts reflecting this design choice.</p>
        <img class="image" src="images/kitchentime_case_study/layout_comparison.png">
        <p class="paragraph">I settled on a design that showcased the main features the app, as well as the primary call to action, in the first section. I attempted to hook a potential user with a relatable situation in the second section, and then explained the app functionality in more detail as the user moved further down the page in the third.</p>
        <img class="image" src="images/kitchentime_case_study/wireframe.png">
        <p class="paragraph">The bottom of the page has a similar call to action as the top, which gives the user another opportunity to respond.</p>
        <p class="title">Visual Design</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Syle Tile</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I went with pastel colors for the icons and app UI elements. I designed the icons from scratch. Initially, when creating my mockups I used Twentieth Century Monotype and bold Script Monotype. I thought the varied typeface in the logo would be more interesting. However, because neither of those typefaces are free, requiring a license, for the final site I ended up finding Google fonts that resembled them as closely as possible: Montserrat and Norican.

        <p class="subtitle">Page Concepts</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I designed three variations of the landing page mockup.</p>
        <img class="image" src="images/kitchentime_case_study/concept_pages.png">
        <p class="title">HTML / CSS Site</p>
        <p class="paragraph">When it came time to code the page itself, I ended up going with the first concept. In the time I had left, I decided to do something a bit more fun. You can view both landing pages as (not fully) functional sites below. I was only requested to mockup a landing page, so the only working buttons link to the Android and Apple stores.</p>
        <p class="paragraph click_here"><a class="here" href="images/kitchentime_case_study/project_4_website/index.html">Click here</a> to view the official KitchenTime landing page.</p>
        <p class="paragraph click_here">To view the alternate landing page <a class="here" href="images/kitchentime_case_study/project_4_alternate/index.html">click here.</a></p>
        <img class="image" src="images/kitchentime_case_study/two_sites.png">
        <p class="paragraph">You can view the entire official landing page below, as well.</p>
        <img class="image" src="images/kitchentime_case_study/landing_page_final.png">
        <p class="title">Retrospective</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I was happy with the end result overall. However, I think I could have been bolder when it came to my color choices, for both the landing page and app UI elements. I think some of that energy went into making the alternate landing page though, which I didn't design for serious consideration, rather just to do something out of the box.</p>
