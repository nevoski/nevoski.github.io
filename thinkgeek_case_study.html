        <p class="title">The Project</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Overview</p>
        <p class="paragraph">ThinkGeek was seeking to expand their retail e-commerce business by creating a marketplace within its site that allows its regularly engaged customers to sell their own fan-based loyalty products within the ThinkGeek brand realm. Some of the important requested features included: allows customers to contact sellers, allow each seller to establish their own brand and points of differentiation from other sellers, allow customers to contact ThinkGeek, allow customers to search for one or more product efficiently, and finally, seamlessly purchase and checkout.</p>
        <p class="title">Research</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Competitive Analyses</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I conducted two competitive analyses: the first was designed to give me a better understanding of ThinkGeek's direct competitors.</p>
        <img class="image" src="images/thinkgeek_case_study/competitor_analysis.png">
        <p class="paragraph">The second was designed to give me a better understanding of common marketplace features to includes in ThinkGeek's own version.</p>

        <p class="subtitle">Card Sorting</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Marketplaces can have a huge variety of items that, due to their handmade and customized nature, can potentially be hard to classify.</p>

        <p class="subtitle">Three Types of ThinkGeek Users</p>
        <img class="image" src="images/thinkgeek_case_study/personas.PNG">
        <p class="paragraph">The project briefing included three personas designed to reflect the three main types of marketplace user that ThinkGeek sought to accommodate.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Jack represents the in-and-out marketplace user, whose main priority is to find an item quickly, and exit the site. Jack is not interested in engaging the community, but possibly glancing at seller reviews in order to better judge a potential purchase.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Taylor represents the more involved marketplace user, who is interested in coming back to the site to see what's new, and to learn more about sellers when they create something he likes.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Shelly represents the most engaged user of the marketplace, requirement the greatest range of functionality. Shelly wants to actually sell her own items, as well as engage other buyers and sellers in the ThinkGeek community.</p>

        <p class="title">Ideation</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Initial Sketching</p>
        <p class="paragraph">ThinkGeek's layout is familiar to its long term users, so in terms of placement of dropdown menus, search bars, etc. I wanted to keep as much of this familiarity as possible, so as not to confuse a user moving between the main site and the marketplace.</p>
        <img class="image" src="images/thinkgeek_case_study/thinkgeek_sketches.png">
        <p class="paragraph">I ended up doing far fewer sketches, at a lower fidelity, than is typical for me. Because I had the preexisting ThinkGeek site to work with, I had a good idea of what the layout of the new pages would be even before sketching, so in order to save time I started building wireframes relatively quickly.</p>
        <p class="title">Wireframing</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I needed to make a large number of screen for this project, but thankfully many of them had the same elements, like the top and side navigation bars, for example. Rather than attempt to explain every one here, view the clickable prototype demo for a better look at the invidual screens.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"></p>
        <p class="title">Clickable Prototype</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Finally, I designed the clickable prototype using Axure. If you would like to click through the pages yourself, <a href="http://n5zwed.axshare.com/#g=1&p=home" id="here">click here</a>. Otherwise, you can view the video demo below.</p>
